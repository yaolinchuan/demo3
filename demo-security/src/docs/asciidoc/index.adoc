Spring REST Docs REST Assured Sample

Sample application demonstrating how to use Spring REST Docs with REST Assured.

SampleRestAssuredApplicationTests makes a call to a very simple service. The service that is being tested is running on a random port on localhost. The tests make use of a preprocessor to modify the request so that it appears to have been sent to https://api.example.com. If your service includes URIs in its responses, for example because it uses hypermedia, similar preprocessing can be applied to the response before it is documented.

Three snippets are produced. One showing how to make a request using cURL:

Unresolved directive in <stdin> - include::{snippets}/sample/curl-request.adoc[]

One showing the HTTP request:

Unresolved directive in <stdin> - include::{snippets}/sample/http-request.adoc[]

And one showing the HTTP response:

Unresolved directive in <stdin> - include::{snippets}/sample/http-response.adoc[]
